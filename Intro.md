its not about watching video

you need to watch then also code along
and after some time you need to make notes on what are the things that you learned

so its necessary for long term retention
also make projects from all the learnings it will solidify the concepts

linkking css with html file

using the link tag rel attribute stylesheet and href = name of the css file

Important Boiler plate code for CSS

<style>
*{
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

html,body{
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
</style>

the reason will be given later

Understanding CSS Writting Way :

dont be dumb and assign names names to the elements using h1 or img
like example

<p id ="h1">

</p>

in case for that we need to style it using

<style>
  #h1{

  }
</style>

this above makes no sense
