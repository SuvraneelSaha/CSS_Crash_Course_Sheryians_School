its not about watching video

you need to watch then also code along
and after some time you need to make notes on what are the things that you learned

so its necessary for long term retention
also make projects from all the learnings it will solidify the concepts

linkking css with html file

using the link tag rel attribute stylesheet and href = name of the css file

Important Boiler plate code for CSS

<style>
*{
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

html,body{
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
</style>

the reason will be given later

Understanding CSS Writting Way :😍

dont be dumb and assign names names to the elements using h1 or img
like example

<p id ="h1">

</p>

in case for that we need to style it using

<style>
  #h1{

  }
</style>

this above makes no sense

Better to use id , class or tag for targetting elements rather than naming elements in a weird way 

its not just about watching videos its about learning from a video 
and implementing the learnings on a project 

Understanding CSS Writting Way :✅

Understanding width and height 
height is the vertical 
width is the horizontal 

done ✅

Understanding px and % 
100% is the width 
ex - 50% of width , 25% of the width 

its easier to understand with respect to the screen size 

px is a small unit which is an abstract measuring way 
but with time we will get used to it 
and in

case of % it can be understood very intuitively as
the size is determined with respect to the screen size 

Understanding Margin and padding 

Margin is the space between two elements

Padding is the space inside an element from the borders 

done ✅

Understanding background images and things related to it 

background-size: decides the size of the image ex - cover for the whole image to be presented
and 
background-position: to show the desired portion of the image  
properties 

done ✅

Understanding Position Absolute📑:
car wala theory one in front of the other 
by position absolute the car will rise up to their level and 
the other cars will adjust accordingly 
ex - there are 3 cars 1 2 3 
if the 2 car postion absolute then 
the 3rd card will be in the 2nd position and the 2nd car will rise up to the 2nd level and will hide the 3rd car when viewed from the top only the 1st car will be seen from the above position 

Understanding Postition Relative ☘ : 
when we want to place a box inside of a rectangle area say 
we want to make the box position absolute to make it appear from the above 
also we want to make sure that the box stays in the rectangular area only 
so we use the rectangular area to be position relative 

done ✅☘


Understanding Flexbox💪:

by default the elements will be from top to bottom 
flexbox by using it 
the elements can be arranged from left to right and from top to bottom also 

so for the left to right ie width - justify content 
and for the top to bottom ie height - align items 

and the axis will be in 2D x axis for width and y axis for height 

Done ✅☘💪🍾
